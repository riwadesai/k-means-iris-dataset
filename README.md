1. Consider the same imported data set. Apply k-means cluster analysis for the choice k = 2, 3, 4.
• Report the cluster statistics (centroids, within cluster variances etc.).
• Prepare a scree plot by plotting SSE(k) against k (number of clusters)
for k = 2,3,4.
• Consider the final clustering solution that you have obtained with k = 3 and consider the generated cluster id for each observation. Compare it with the species types and comment how good this segmentation corresponds variations due to different species types.
You may prepare a 3 × 3 frequency table of species type vs. cluster id.
2. Consider the same imported data set. Apply hierarchical cluster analysis with average distance method and consider the generated 3 clusters from it. Compare the generated segmentation with the earlier k-means solution for k = 3. How closely they match?
3. Consider the same imported data set. Do the k-means cluster analysis for the choice k = 3 using a distance measure which is based on the 4 numeric variables as well as the one categorical variable “SpeciesType”.
